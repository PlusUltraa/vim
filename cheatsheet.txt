-- Increment
say you have a sequance of code:

data[0]
data[0]
data[0]
data[0]

and you want to increment the index of the array.
A fast way to do so is to get in visual block, select all indexes and press: g + ctrl a
                                 visual line, select all lines with indexes and press: g + ctrl a

data[1]
data[2]
data[3]
data[4]
